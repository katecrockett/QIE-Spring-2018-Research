# QIE-Spring-2018-Research
## Intro

Hey Morgan, let's get this fired up! I'm still fiddling around with github code so bear with me. My F key is also MIA at the moment. Literally ripped itself from my keyboard in bed this morning. Anyway,

### [Americans and Cybersecurity 2016](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/01/26/americans-and-cybersecurity/) 

The original article ^ pointed out a disconnect between what people think and what people do (i.e., hypocrites); data are comprised of a national survey of 1,047 adults on their cybersecurity habits and attitudes. Not much grit here regarding actual data breach occurances, just opinion and experience recounting. The article outlining the survey references several other studies––this is an ongoing point of study, which means there are many data. I think it's worth checking out other (up-to-date) datasets after we give this set a good twice-over. Let's focus on America, though, for sanity's sake. Don't even get me started on Russia.

A lot of Americans have received notices about their accounts being compromised that are scary AF. This is a cool direction to go in for a topic considering the likelihood that social security numbers will be a thing of the past soon. Also relevant because the majority of Americans' trust level in Trump––and the federal gov. by extention––is like 0.  

Also hilarious that 86% of people "memorize their passwords in their heads" which really just means they rotate 3 and frequently reset any that fall outside of that 3. Totally need to tie in password management software to our independent research.
