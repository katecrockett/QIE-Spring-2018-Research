# Russian Tweets Investigation

Good moorrrrrning. I found this NBC article that includes .csv files of the 200,000 fake Russian tweets deleted by Twitter. OMG. I spent the whole morning searching for legitimate dataset downloads and _this_ is where I find one? Nevermind, though, because this is fascinating. 

There are two datasets: **users and tweets.** Looking at the user dataset, I think we could convert the fake users into binary categories; they appear to either be a classic 'conservative' profile (e.g."Wife, Mother, Patriot", "#NRA") or a 'liberal profile', as denoted by being a black lives matter advocate (e.g., "Black is the new black", "#staywoke") as denoted by the **description** column. Looking at the tweet dataset, I think we could convert the actual tweets into favoring Trump or favoring Hillary, as these were clearly meant to influence the U.S. election. For example, one user tweeted, _""RT @Shareblue: Pence and his lawyers decided which of his official emails the public could see by @alisonrose711"_. Another tweeted, _"RT @AriaWilsonGOP: 3 Women Face Charges After Being Caught Stealing Dozens Of Trump Signs"_.
