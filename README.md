# Abstract

Obtaining a college degree has a positive effect on earnings. Many have analyzed the economic return of a degree based on the name of the institution, but there is little empirical evidence regarding the economic success of individuals‚Äô based on their major, besides the inquiry done by Black, Sanders, and Taylor in July 2003. We attempt to provide a concise, updated replica of their study using a dataset from 2015, which contains responses from thousands of college graduates. Similarly to Black, Sanders, and Taylor, we find that economics majors accrue higher earnings, on average, than demographically similar individuals who chose other fields of study. 

# Purpose 

As economics majors, we have sought to quantify our major choice with the stand-alone study conducted by Black, Sanders, and Taylor, yet we find it to be out of date. With fresh data to work with, we hope to provide an accurate representation of today's labor market for college graduates. 

For a college student, having a clear understanding of what their future earnings will look like, depending on their major choice, is essential to ensure that the student makes a well informed decision. We suggest that students must consider their field of study just as closely the quality of the institution they attend. We aim to clarify possible earnings outcomes by major choice. 

# Data

Outcome (Y): Annual earnings

Treatment (X): Choice of college major

Our dataset came from the 2015 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), with a total of 91,000 observations. 

# Descriptive Statistics 

In a T-Test comparing the mean earnings of economics majors and the mean earnings of all other majors, we find that economics majors accrue higher earnings, on average, when compared to all other majors. The p-value of 9.043e-08 tells us that this is statistically significant at the 1% level.

In comparison to male economics majors, female economics majors accrue less annual earnings, on average, compared to male economics majors. The p-value of 2.07e-06 tells us that this is statistically significant at the 1% level. 

# Limitations 

While our results show us that economics majors earn more on average when compared to other college majors, we are unable to establish causation between majoring economics and accruing higher earnings. We acknowledge that our study is laced with selection bias; students who choose to major in economics are systematically different from other majors in ways that would yield higher earnings regardless of major choice. We bear in mind that we are reviewing individuals who have already proved themselves gritty by graduating with a degree in economics ‚Äì they are likely to be gritty in other ways that will increase their earnings potential. Similar to how a student who attends a selective college institution would likely make more regardless of school choice. Additionally, individuals who accrue unusually high or unusually low earnings may skew the earnings outcomes. 

# Economics 

We examine the economic outcome of investing time, money, and energy into attaining a college degree and the returns which follow. Our focus revolves around a cost-benefit analysis of major choice. We also explore how the return on investment for a degree in economics varies across race and gender spectrums, useful to policymakers who work to eliminate gender and racial wage gaps. 

# Preliminary Results

Where Y= earnings, ùíÜùíÑùíêùíè= a dummy variable for majoring in economics, M= a vector of dummy variables for five other majors: accounting, business administration or management, electrical engineering, arts and humanities related majors, and political science.  ùëΩ= a vector of controls including age, race, gender, parental education level, whether children live in the household, spousal employment status, size of employer, citizenship status, job steadiness, minority status, region of birth, type of employer institution,  marital status, number of degrees, highest degree type, and employer support for graduate education. 

We find that economics majors earn ~$37,000 more on average when compared to all other college majors. Math and Statistics majors earn ~$10,600 more on average per year; Poltiical Science majors, ~$14,500; Management Administration majors, ~$8,300; Electrical Engineering majors, ~$13,400; Arts and Humanities, ~$11,400 less. This shows us that the premium for majoring in economics is higher than the premium for majoring in any other field.

# Further Research 

Include and test interaction variables in additional regressions
Make the earnings variable more statistically accurate by creating a natural log
Follow up with new research questions:
What is the propensity among majors for pursuing advanced degrees?
How do wage gaps differ given an age category under the age of 35?
